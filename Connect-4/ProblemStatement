Connect Four (or Connect - 4) is a two-player connection board game,
in which the players choose a color and then take turns dropping colored discs into a seven-column, 
six-row vertically suspended grid. The pieces fall straight down, occupying the lowest available 
space within the column. The objective of the game is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical,
 or diagonal line of four of one's own discs. Connect Four is a solved game. 
The first player can always win by playing the right moves.
